\nTo participate in the Event, each player must agree (or, if a Minor (as defined below), such player’s parent or legal guardian must agree on such player’s behalf) to follow these Rules at all times, including the Code of Conduct in Section 8. A player (or, if a Minor, such player’s parent or legal guardian) may accept these Rules by clicking to accept or agree to these Rules, where this option is made available to you by Epic Games, Inc.

\n<br />\
\n1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Amendments<br />\
\n<br />\
\nEpic may update, revise, change, or modify these Rules from time to time.
